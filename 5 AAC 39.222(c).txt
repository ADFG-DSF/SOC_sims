(c) Management of salmon fisheries by the state should be based on the following principles and criteria:   

 	(1) wild salmon stocks and the salmon's habitats should be maintained at levels of resource productivity that assure sustained yields as follows:   

 		(A) salmon spawning, rearing, and migratory habitats should be protected as follows:   

 		 	(i) salmon habitats should not be perturbed beyond natural boundaries of variation;   

 		 	(ii) scientific assessments of possible adverse ecological effects of proposed habitat alterations and the impacts of the alterations on salmon populations should be conducted before approval of a proposal;   

 		 	(iii) adverse environmental impacts on wild salmon stocks and the salmon's habitats should be assessed;   

 		 	(iv) all essential salmon habitat in marine, estuarine, and freshwater ecosystems and access of salmon to these habitats should be protected; essential habitats include spawning and incubation areas, freshwater rearing areas, estuarine and nearshore rearing areas, offshore rearing areas, and migratory pathways;   

 		 	(v) salmon habitat in fresh water should be protected on a watershed basis, including appropriate management of riparian zones, water quality, and water quantity;   

 		(B) salmon stocks should be protected within spawning, incubating, rearing, and migratory habitats;   

 		(C) degraded salmon productivity resulting from habitat loss should be assessed, considered, and controlled by affected user groups, regulatory agencies, and boards when making conservation and allocation decisions;   

 		(D) effects and interactions of introduced or enhanced salmon stocks on wild salmon stocks should be assessed; wild salmon stocks and fisheries on those stocks should be protected from adverse impacts from artificial propagation and enhancement efforts;   

 		(E) degraded salmon spawning, incubating, rearing, and migratory habitats should be restored to natural levels of productivity where known and desirable;   

 		(F) ongoing monitoring should be conducted to determine the current status of habitat and the effectiveness of restoration activities;   

 		(G) depleted salmon stocks should be allowed to recover or, where appropriate, should be actively restored; diversity should be maintained to the maximum extent possible, at the genetic, population, species, and ecosystem levels;   

 	(2) salmon fisheries shall be managed to allow escapements within ranges necessary to conserve and sustain potential salmon production and maintain normal ecosystem functioning as follows:   

 		(A) salmon spawning escapements should be assessed both temporally and geographically; escapement monitoring programs should be appropriate to the scale, intensity, and importance of each salmon stock's use;   

 		(B) salmon escapement goals, whether sustainable escapement goals, biological escapement goals, optimal escapement goals, or inriver run goals, should be established in a manner consistent with sustained yield; unless otherwise directed, the department will manage Alaska's salmon fisheries, to the extent possible, for maximum sustained yield;   

 		(C) salmon escapement goal ranges should allow for uncertainty associated with measurement techniques, observed variability in the salmon stock measured, changes in climatic and oceanographic conditions, and varying abundance within related populations of the salmon stock measured;   

 		(D) salmon escapement should be managed in a manner to maintain genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the stock by assuring appropriate geographic and temporal distribution of spawners as well as consideration of size range, sex ratio, and other population attributes;   

 		(E) impacts of fishing, including incidental mortality and other human-induced mortality, should be assessed and considered in harvest management decisions;   

 		(F) salmon escapement and harvest management decisions should be made in a manner that protects nontarget salmon stocks or species;   

 		(G) the role of salmon in ecosystem functioning should be evaluated and considered in harvest management decisions and setting of salmon escapement goals;   

 		(H) salmon abundance trends should be monitored and considered in harvest management decisions;   

 	(3) effective management systems should be established and applied to regulate human activities that affect salmon as follows:   

 		(A) salmon management objectives should be appropriate to the scale and intensity of various uses and the biological capacities of target salmon stocks;   

 		(B) management objectives should be established in harvest management plans, strategies, guiding principles, and policies, such as for mixed stock fishery harvests, fish disease, genetics, and hatchery production, that are subject to periodic review;   

 		(C) when wild salmon stocks are fully allocated, new fisheries or expanding fisheries should be restricted, unless provided for by management plans or by application of the board's allocation criteria;   

 		(D) management agencies should have clear authority in statute and regulation to   

 		 	(i) control all sources of fishing mortality on salmon;   

 		 	(ii) protect salmon habitats and control nonfishing sources of mortality;   

 		(E) management programs should be effective in   

 		 	(i) controlling human-induced sources of fishing mortality and should incorporate procedures to assure effective monitoring, compliance, control, and enforcement;   

 		 	(ii) protecting salmon habitats and controlling collateral mortality and should incorporate procedures to assure effective monitoring, compliance, control, and enforcement;   

 		(F) fisheries management implementation and outcomes should be consistent with regulations, regulations should be consistent with statutes, and effectively carry out the purpose of this section;   

 		(G) the board will recommend to the commissioner the development of effective joint research, assessment, and management arrangements with appropriate management agencies and bodies for salmon stocks that cross state, federal, or international jurisdictional boundaries; the board will recommend the coordination of appropriate procedures for effective monitoring, compliance, control, and enforcement with those of other agencies, states, or nations;   

 		(H) the board will work, within the limits of its authority, to assure that   

 		 	(i) management activities are accomplished in a timely and responsive manner to implement objectives, based on the best available scientific information;   

 		 	(ii) effective mechanisms for the collection and dissemination of information and data necessary to carry out management activities are developed, maintained, and utilized;   

 		 	(iii) management programs and decision-making procedures are able to clearly distinguish, and effectively deal with, biological and allocation issues;   

 		(I) the board will recommend to the commissioner and legislature that adequate staff and budget for research, management, and enforcement activities be available to fully implement sustainable salmon fisheries principles;   

 		(J) proposals for salmon fisheries development or expansion and artificial propagation and enhancement should include assessments required for sustainable management of existing salmon fisheries and wild salmon stocks;   

 		(K) plans and proposals for development or expansion of salmon fisheries and enhancement programs should effectively document resource assessments, potential impacts, and other information needed to assure sustainable management of wild salmon stocks;   

 		(L) the board will work with the commissioner and other agencies to develop effective processes for controlling excess fishing capacity;   

 		(M) procedures should be implemented to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of fishery management and habitat protection actions in sustaining salmon populations, fisheries, and habitat, and to resolve associated problems or deficiencies;   

 		(N) conservation and management decisions for salmon fisheries should take into account the best available information on biological, environmental, economic, social, and resource use factors;   

 		(O) research and data collection should be undertaken to improve scientific and technical knowledge of salmon fisheries, including ecosystem interactions, status of salmon populations, and the condition of salmon habitats;   

 		(P) the best available scientific information on the status of salmon populations and the condition of the salmon's habitats should be routinely updated and subject to peer review;   

 	(4) public support and involvement for sustained use and protection of salmon resources should be sought and encouraged as follows:   

 		(A) effective mechanisms for dispute resolution should be developed and used;   

 		(B) pertinent information and decisions should be effectively disseminated to all interested parties in a timely manner;   

 		(C) the board's regulatory management and allocation decisions will be made in an open process with public involvement;   

 		(D) an understanding of the proportion of mortality inflicted on each salmon stock by each user group, should be promoted, and the burden of conservation should be allocated across user groups in a manner consistent with applicable state and federal statutes, including AS 16.05.251(e) and AS 16.05.258; in the absence of a regulatory management plan that otherwise allocates or restricts harvests, and when it is necessary to restrict fisheries on salmon stocks where there are known conservation problems, the burden of conservation shall be shared among all fisheries in close proportion to each fisheries' respective use, consistent with state and federal law;   

 		(E) the board will work with the commissioner and other agencies as necessary to assure that adequately funded public information and education programs provide timely materials on salmon conservation, including habitat requirements, threats to salmon habitat, the value of salmon and habitat to the public and ecosystem (fish and wildlife), natural variability and population dynamics, the status of salmon stocks and fisheries, and the regulatory process;  

 	(5) in the face of uncertainty, salmon stocks, fisheries, artificial propagation, and essential habitats shall be managed conservatively as follows:   

 		(A) a precautionary approach, involving the application of prudent foresight that takes into account the uncertainties in salmon fisheries and habitat management, the biological, social, cultural, and economic risks, and the need to take action with incomplete knowledge, should be applied to the regulation and control of harvest and other human-induced sources of salmon mortality; a precautionary approach requires   

 		 	(i) consideration of the needs of future generations and avoidance of potentially irreversible changes;   

 		 	(ii) prior identification of undesirable outcomes and of measures that will avoid undesirable outcomes or correct them promptly;   

 		 	(iii) initiation of any necessary corrective measure without delay and prompt achievement of the measure's purpose, on a time scale not exceeding five years, which is approximately the generation time of most salmon species;   

 		 	(iv) that where the impact of resource use is uncertain, but likely presents a measurable risk to sustained yield, priority should be given to conserving the productive capacity of the resource;   

 		 	(v) appropriate placement of the burden of proof, of adherence to the requirements of this subparagraph, on those plans or ongoing activities that pose a risk or hazard to salmon habitat or production;   

 		(B) a precautionary approach should be applied to the regulation of activities that affect essential salmon habitat.
