# SOC_sims

This repository contains spawner-recruit and harvest simulations intended to mimic a wide range of salmon stocks and fisheries. It was created as part of the 2024 Escapement Goal Policy Review Team (EGPIT) and intended to provide a framework to propose and evaluate policy recommendations related to the Stock of Concern (SOC) process. SPecific goals include:

-   To suggest new definitions for yield and management concerns that clarify both the reason for the designation and the Departmentâ€™s responsibility once a designation is recommended to the Board.

-   Establish a connection between SOC designations and reductions in the productivity of a salmon stock.

-   Evaluate the appropriate criteria ADF&G should use to define *chronic inability*.

-   Establish recommendations for rebuilding a stock which has been declared a stock of concern.

-   Demonstrate the sensitivity of salmon population dynamics to the shape of the spawner-recruit relationship at low levels of population abundance.
