(d) The principles and criteria for sustainable salmon fisheries shall be applied, by the department and the board using the best available information, as follows:   

 	(1) at regular meetings of the board, the department will, to the extent practicable, provide the board with reports on the status of salmon stocks and salmon fisheries under consideration for regulatory changes, which should include   

 		(A) a stock-by-stock assessment of the extent to which the management of salmon stocks and fisheries is consistent with the principles and criteria contained in the policy under this section;   

 		(B) descriptions of habitat status and any habitat concerns;   

 		(C) identification of healthy salmon stocks and sustainable salmon fisheries;   

 		(D) identification of any existing salmon escapement goals, or management actions needed to achieve these goals, that may have allocative consequences such as the   

 		 	(i) identification of a new fishery or expanding fishery;   

 		 	(ii) identification of any salmon stocks, or populations within stocks, that present a concern related to yield, management, or conservation; and   

 		 	(iii) description of management and research options to address salmon stock or habitat concerns;   

 	(2)N in response to the department's salmon stock status reports, reports from other resource agencies, and public input, the board will review the management plan, or consider developing a management plan, for each affected salmon fishery or stock; management plans will be based on the principles and criteria contained in this policy and will   

 		(A) contain goals and measurable and implementable objectives that are reviewed on a regular basis and utilize the best available scientific information;   

 		(B) minimize the adverse effects on salmon habitat caused by fishing;   

 		(C) protect, restore, and promote the long-term health and sustainability of the salmon fishery and habitat;   

 		(D) prevent overfishing; and   

 		(E) provide conservation and management measures that are necessary and appropriate to promote maximum or optimum sustained yield of the fishery resource;   

 	(3) in the course of review of the salmon stock status reports and management plans described in (1) and (2) of this subsection, the board, in consultation with the department, will determine if any new fisheries or expanding fisheries, stock yield concerns, stock management concerns, or stock conservation concerns exist; if so, the board will, as appropriate, amend or develop salmon fishery management plans to address these concerns; the extent of regulatory action, if any, should be commensurate with the level of concerns and range from milder to stronger as concerns range from new and expanding salmon fisheries through yield concerns, management concerns, and conservation concerns;   

 	(4) in association with the appropriate management plan, the department and the board will, as appropriate, collaborate in the development and periodic review of an action plan for any new or expanding salmon fisheries, or stocks of concern; action plans should contain goals, measurable and implementable objectives, and provisions, including   

 		(A) measures required to restore and protect salmon habitat, including necessary coordination with other agencies and organizations;   

 		(B) identification of salmon stock or population rebuilding goals and objectives;   

 		(C) fishery management actions needed to achieve rebuilding goals and objectives, in proportion to each fishery's use of, and hazards posed to, a salmon stock;   

 		(D) descriptions of new or expanding salmon fisheries, management concern, yield concern, or conservation concern; and   

 		(E) performance measures appropriate for monitoring and gauging the effectiveness of the action plan that are derived from the principles and criteria contained in this policy;   

 	(5) each action plan will include a research plan as necessary to provide information to address concerns; research needs and priorities will be evaluated periodically, based on the effectiveness of the monitoring described in (4) of this subsection;   

 	(6) where actions needed to regulate human activities that affect salmon and salmon's habitat that are outside the authority of the department or the board, the department or board shall correspond with the relevant authority, including the governor, relevant boards and commissions, commissioners, and chairs of appropriate legislative committees, to describe the issue and recommend appropriate action.
